This is the greatest app ever made in a UofA bootcamp class, Make or break is a great way to connect with your friends, family and complete strangers with an insult of the day or a loving complement. Make or Break calls on two apis to fill a database with both loving compliments and insults and offers users the ability to send these randomly selected phrases to any phone they choose. If the randomly generated insult or loving comment is not to the users taste they can enter in their own insult and add it to our database. Users can even browse the most popular content from our database that users are sending out to the world. 

Technologies Used

Twilio - (New technology)
Insult Generator
 Love As A Service - (this is not creepy itâ€™s nice)


Ice Box:
