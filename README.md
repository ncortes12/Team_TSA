## Make || Break

The One Site To Make or Break Someone's Day Anonymously

# Proposal:

This is the greatest app ever made in a UofA boot camp class, Make or break is a great way to connect with your friends, family and complete strangers with an insult of the day or a loving complement. Make or Break calls on two apis to fill a database with both loving compliments and insults and offers users the ability to send these randomly selected phrases to any phone they choose. If the randomly generated insult or loving comment is not to the users taste they can enter in their own insult and add it to our database. Users can even browse the most popular content from our database that users are sending out to the world. 

# User experience. 

Login in to your unique user page using google authentication.
Choose to generate either a compliment or an insult.
Send the message to a cell phone number of your choice.

# Future Improvements

Ability to save favorite messages.
Ability to customize messages
Option to send your message via email or slack.
Displaying the most popular messages for quick access to users.

# Team collaboration. 

Team TSA (Team Smart Assess) worked well together primarily working on slack as a group and working on individual tasks agreed upon during the initial planning phase. Git hub was a the most challenging part of the project for the team teaching valuable lessons about checking out new branches and not stepping in on or writing over other peoples code. While the project was ambitious from the start near the end of the project many or the plans for the app got slashed and burned to make sure a MVP was deployed in time for presentation day. 

# Lessons learned. 

While several quality apis where found, adding complements and insults in to our own database will make for better control of the app and more features being added for the users. Never assign two people to work independently on the same file, even if they code they are working on are not related.
